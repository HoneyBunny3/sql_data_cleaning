# The Differences Between PL/SQL and SQL

The difference between the **SQL script** and the **PL/SQL script** lies in their design, capabilities, and use cases, stemming from the fundamental nature of SQL versus PL/SQL. Here's a deeper explanation:

---

### **Why SQL and PL/SQL Are Different**
1. **Nature of SQL**:
   - SQL (Structured Query Language) is **declarative**.
   - It focuses on **what** data you want to retrieve, update, delete, or insert.
   - Each SQL query is an independent statement executed by the database engine.
   - It doesn't have procedural capabilities like loops, conditionals, or error handling within a single statement.

   **Limitations**:
   - SQL alone cannot handle procedural logic (e.g., looping through records, conditionally processing data).
   - It lacks built-in support for intermediate logging or debugging.
   - SQL is static: once a query is written and executed, it fetches the results but cannot "act" upon them programmatically.

2. **Nature of PL/SQL**:
   - PL/SQL (Procedural Language extensions for SQL) is **procedural** and **programmatic**.
   - It allows you to combine SQL queries with programming constructs like loops, conditionals (`IF/THEN/ELSE`), and exception handling.
   - It enables you to define dynamic logic where queries can adapt, log their progress, and react to errors at runtime.

   **Advantages**:
   - **Dynamic Execution**: PL/SQL can dynamically build and execute SQL queries based on program logic, such as user input or conditional branching.
   - **Error Handling**: It gracefully handles exceptions using `EXCEPTION ... WHEN`, allowing you to log or recover from errors without crashing the script.
   - **Intermediate Logging**: With `DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE`, you can log meaningful messages during execution, providing visibility into what the script is doing.
   - **Loops and Logic**: PL/SQL supports procedural constructs (`FOR`, `WHILE`, `CASE`) that enable complex workflows (e.g., iterating through rows, conditional operations).

---

### **Why PL/SQL Is More Dynamic**
PL/SQL extends the capabilities of SQL by combining it with procedural programming, making it suitable for more complex and dynamic workflows. Hereâ€™s why PL/SQL is inherently more dynamic:

1. **Combining Queries with Logic**:
   - Example: PL/SQL can iterate over each record in a query result, process it, and dynamically decide whether to update, delete, or skip it. SQL alone cannot do this.

   ```plsql
   FOR rec IN (SELECT * FROM contracts WHERE MA_PRCH_LMT_AM > 0) LOOP
       IF rec.MA_PRCH_LMT_AM > 100000 THEN
           DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('High spending: ' || rec.LGL_NM);
       END IF;
   END LOOP;
   ```

2. **Dynamic SQL Execution**:
   - PL/SQL can generate SQL statements at runtime and execute them dynamically using `EXECUTE IMMEDIATE`. This allows scripts to adapt based on conditions or input.

3. **Control Flow**:
   - PL/SQL supports control flow constructs (`IF`, `CASE`, `LOOP`) for conditional or iterative operations that aren't possible with SQL alone.

4. **Resilience**:
   - PL/SQL can gracefully recover from runtime errors (e.g., network issues, invalid data) using `EXCEPTION` blocks. SQL scripts terminate abruptly on encountering an error.

5. **Logging**:
   - PL/SQL provides the ability to output log messages during script execution, helping you debug or track progress in real time (`DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE`).

### **When to Use SQL vs. PL/SQL**
| Use Case                                      | SQL Script                        | PL/SQL Script                     |
|-----------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| **Data Retrieval and Reporting**              | SQL (direct queries are sufficient)| Use PL/SQL if iterative logic is needed.|
| **Batch Data Processing (Updates/Transform)** | Limited, unless very simple        | Preferred for looping, dynamic conditions, or logging.|
| **Error Handling**                            | None                               | Full support for handling and recovery.|
| **Dynamic Execution (Generated SQL)**         | Not supported                      | Fully supported with `EXECUTE IMMEDIATE`.|
| **Real-Time Progress Monitoring**             | Not supported                      | Supported with `DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE`.|

### **Why PL/SQL Is More Dynamic**:
- **Programming Constructs**: PL/SQL is a programming language with constructs that make it suitable for procedural tasks.
- **Error Recovery**: It can dynamically react to problems and log details, making it more robust.
- **Adaptability**: It supports runtime decisions, dynamic SQL, and intermediate logging.
- **Integration**: It allows SQL to work alongside procedural logic, turning static queries into interactive workflows.
